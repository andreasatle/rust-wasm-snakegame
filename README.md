# Snake Game

This game is greatly inspired by the Udemy course ["Rust & WebAssembly with JS (TS) - The Practical Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-webassembly-with-js-ts-the-practical-guide/).

* The game engine is written in Rust and compiled to [Wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).
* The web interface is written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* An [Express server](https://expressjs.com/) is used for the final build.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used to setup a development environment and build the final product.
